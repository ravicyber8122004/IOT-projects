# 🚀 Ravi Rathor's IoT Projects Repository

![LOGO](logo.avif)

Welcome to my **IoT Projects Collection**, where I explore and build real-world Internet of Things (IoT) solutions using **Arduino**, **sensors**, **actuators**, and **embedded systems**.
Each project focuses on learning, innovation, and practical application — all simulated on Tinkercad or built on real hardware.
